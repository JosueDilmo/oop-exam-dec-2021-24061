Write notes on the following terms: 
1.	inheritance, 
2.	polymorphism, 
3.	static member variables and methods,
4.	interfaces, and 
5.	abstract classes. 
Your answer should include an explanation of each term, example of its use and an explanation of when you would use it.

1- Inheritance eliminate redundant code and 
reuse fields and methods of an existing class when the user create a new class.
the parent class its the class being inherited from;
the child class its the class that inherits from another class;
Using inheritance you can create a class base and later you can create a new class that will
have the same fields or methods without typing all the code again.

2- Polymorphism reuse methods to perform different tasks. 
Polymorphism allow the user to perform a single action in different ways.
Derived classes of a Parent class Vehicle with a method vehicleHonk() could
have their own implementation of vehicleHonk (car bibi, bus fonfon, motorbike anothersound).



4 -Interfaces are implemented by a class implicitly or explicitly. Like a class 
an Interface can have methods, properties, events and indexers. It should
be fully implemented. Interfaces are used to implement peripheral abilities
of class. It contains only a declaration part and methods. It does not 
contain constructor or static members, it only contains public access 
modifiers.


5 - Abstract classes are used as a base class in class hierarchy, 
it is used to implement the core identity of class. It can be fully, 
partially or not implemented. Abstract classes must have at least one
abstract method (which can be override in the child class). Abstract classes
is a way to achieve abstraction and make the code more secure.
